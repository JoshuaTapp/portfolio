    "bio":"Iâ€™m interested in a bit of everything right now. I have really enjoyed my exposure to abstract algebra, number theory, encryption, algorithm analysis, etc. However, this is probably due to being so heavy on Maths during my current schooling. Besides Maths, I am starting to dive deep into Data structures, compilers, databases, and cybersecurity. Taking every class I can!",
